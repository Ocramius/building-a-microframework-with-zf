# intro

 - who am I
 - what do I do?
 - what is this talk about?
    - not many practical examples
    - more focus on the "why"
    
# what is a micro-framework?

 - ask the audience
 - a micro-framework is a non-invasive framework
 - a micro-framework is minimal, yet structured
 - a micro-framework encourages good coding practices, yet maintaining code concise
 - a micro-framework reduces focus on application logic, increasing focus on domain logic
   
# where do we use a micro-framework?

 - small bounded contexts
 - prototyping around an existing domain
 - web pages? Nah, use static HTML for that.
 
# types of micro-framework?

 - the following are all micro-frameworks:
    - symfony/console is a micro-framework
    - silex
    - penny
    - lumen
    - react/http
    - zendframework/zend-expressive

# let's make an example

 - we're in Vegas
 - let's design a domain!
    - Poker!
    - (by the way, I don't know the rules of Poker)
