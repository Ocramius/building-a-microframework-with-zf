# where to start

 - do you know where to start?
 - did you discuss anything with the team?
 - design domain models first
 - import the framework later
 
# designing the domain

 - mostly suggestions by @mathiasverraes
 
# splitting the domain?

 - split only if you can deploy it separately
 - otherwise, keep it together (you are just adding complexity)
